# homework-diff-checker
This python algorithm compares every file in a directory against every other file, and scores them based on how different they are from each other. Its main intention is as a grading tool, to make sure code that students submit are all different and not copies of other code. 

# Usage

Run the algorithm one directory outside of the directory with the homework, and select the directory that contains all of the submitted homeworks. Then, wait for completion. The algorithm outputs its solution to the console, and to a csv file called 'out.txt'
